//// Nakai has several "builders" that can be used.
//// - A `document` builder (the recommend one) that renders a full HTML document,
////   does a little magic to dedepulicate `<head>` elements, and some other things
////   that generally fit the theme of "rendering a full, valid, HTML document"
//// - An `inline` builder that should mostly be used for snippets, and partial bits of
////   HTML that will be inlined into a full document; hence the name. It renders things
////   much more literally. If you tell it to give you a `<head>` element inside a
////   `<p>`, it will, as an example. As a benefit for the trade off, it can be much
////   faster for certain use cases.
//// - A future experimental DOM renderer (meant for use in the browser) that isn't
////   actually done yet.
